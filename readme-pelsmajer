Change on Jan13, 2005: first parameter of rot() changed from float to int

-----------------------------------
(Why we made this change:)

Since rot() has an integer-valued rotation parameter, the smallest rotation 
speed is "1", whatever that means.  Well, if you run 4Dtetris and mess with 
the mouse, you'll see that there is a significant range of the mouse position 
that produces the smallest rotation speed - this corresponds to "1".  
Really, there are only a few integer values that are used.  
 
The reason that the original Rotor.C has a larger dead zone is because the 
parameter*torq is too close to zero there, so is cast as zero.

gkf:
doubled the dead zone from 20 to 40. Under the new regime, the zone was 
too small. We still need a bullseye, and eventually, graffiti.
