Picked up the .zip in Bernard's public directory, the one
he points to on his webpage, but I suppressed for privacy.
I cleaned out the .o and executables, and removed the 
historical zips, and rezipped a provisionally clean copy. 

It took Stuart Levy a good hour to get this to compile on
the Mac. Not all modifications are documented, unhappily.

There are several .zip snapshots of the progress of changes.
4Dtetris is the first and does not compile
hypertetris is the one Stuart made to compile
nutetris is where Mike made changes
Currently nutetris is the latest, but they'll be renamed.
